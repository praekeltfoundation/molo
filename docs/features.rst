Existing Plugins

Please see :ref:`Installing plugins <installing-plugins>` for installation details.

.. _molo-profiles:

molo.profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``Github``: https://github.com/praekelt/molo.profiles

Profiles provides user profiles which adds registration, login and user data functionality.

This library does not provide a Django user model, it provides a profile model that can be attached to a user. Our experience is that custom User models in Django add all sorts of unpleasantries when using migrations.

Main features:
    - Loging/Registration
    - User profile to store user data

.. _molo-commenting:

molo.commenting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``Github``: https://github.com/praekelt/molo.commenting

Commenting builds on the :ref:`molo.profiles <molo-profiles>` plugin. It allows users to comment on articles and these comments to be moderated.

It is built using Django's `Comments Framework`_.

Main features:
    - Commenting on article pages
    - Moderation of comments using django-admin
    - Comment reporting by users to allow for community moderation
        - `COMMENTS_FLAG_THRESHHOLD` allows for comments to be automatically removed if they have been reported by multiple users

molo.yourwords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``Github``: https://github.com/praekelt/molo.yourwords

YourWords (User generated content) allows users to submit content that can be converted into an article by an admin.
