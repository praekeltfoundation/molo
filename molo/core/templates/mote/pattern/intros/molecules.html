                    <h1>Molecules</h1>

                        <p>In chemistry, molecules are groups of atoms bonded together, which take on new properties as a result.</p>
                        <p>In interfaces, molecules are groups of elements that function together as a unit. For example, a form label, search input, and button atom can combine them together to form a search form molecule.</p>
                        <p>Building up from atoms to molecules encourages a “do one thing and do it well” mentality, and encourages creating reusable interface patterns.</p>
