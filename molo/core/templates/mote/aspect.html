  <h2 class="content__heading-large">Workflow Diagram</h2>
  <p>To really experience the full benefits of the design system we want to propose a new workflow that is not about designing pages but rather designing components.</p>
  <h4 class="content__heading-small">When a new feature that is not part of the Design System is requested 2 things can happen:</h4>
  <ul class="ordered-list">
    <li class="ordered-list__item">If it’s a simple feature the service designer might be able to take the component library and build the feature</li>
    <li class="ordered-list__item">If it’s more complicated the developer and designer might have to be pulled into the discussion earlier on in order to design the new feature</li>
  </ul>
  <p>BUT VERY IMPORTANT: Before a new feature is created it’s important to make sure that it’s not just a tweak to a current feature. In that case the feature can rather be altered to accommodate the adjustment and added to the Design System - remember to mark patterns that have been updated in the system so teammates can see.</p>

    <h5 class="content__description">The Pattern library will be actively developed to enable developers to uniform applications while adhering to CSS best practices and conventions</h5>

    <h4 class="content__heading-small">Why design a Pattern Library Markup?</h4>
    <p>Design Systems entail that your prototype is built from functioning HTML, CSS and JavaScript code, which means QA iteration and vetting has taken place, this minimises bugs and time taken to do bug fixes as parties get familiar with the product</p>
    <p>This increases FED and the rest of the engineering productivity</p>
    <p>Streamline and automate the project project setup to maximum and enforce standards and minimised errors</p>

    <h4 class="content__heading-small">In order to achieve this, we have chosen to use very specific naming techniques</h4>
    <ul class="unordered-list">
      <li class="unordered-list__item"><strong>BEM Naming</strong><br/>BEM is a known method of naming components — block, element, modifier. For those unfamiliar, let’s briefly look at how BEM works below.</li>
      <li class="unordered-list__item"><strong>Block</strong><br/>A block represents the main component name. e.g. <span class="highlighter">call-to-action</span></li>
      <li class="unordered-list__item"><strong>Element</strong><br/>An element represents a part of a component and is separated by two underscores. e.g. <span class="highlighter">call-to-action__green</span></li>
      <li class="unordered-list__item"><strong>Modifier</strong><br/>A modifier is a component or element variation and is separated by two dashes. The variation can apply to the overall component or it can be applied to an element within the component. e.g. <span class="highlighter">call-to-action--main</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="content__heading-small">Standards Compliant Markup:</h4>
    <p>The semantic markup in our components are based on W3C standards and industry best practices.</p>
    <h4 class="content__heading-small">Appropriate use of color:</h4>
    <p>We provide the basic combinations of text and their background colors for slow end feature phones and build our way up to smart-phones</p><br/><br/>
