Installation
============

Molo 8.0.0+ requires Python 3.5+ to be installed (Python 3.8 recommended). This installation method also requires pip. Both of these must be installed before following the installation steps below.

Installing Molo
---------------

Molo can be then installed using::

    $ virtualenv ve
    $ source ve/bin/activate
    (ve)$ pip install molo.core

.. _python: https://www.python.org/
.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html

Getting Started
===============

Molo scaffolds a Django application for you with sensible defaults, packages
and configuration to help you get going as soon as possible.

Scaffold a site using Molo
--------------------------

The goal of Molo is to provide a solid base of proven, stable packages that
help Praekelt Foundation and partners to deliver on project scope::

   $ molo scaffold myapp
   $ cd myapp/
   $ ./manage.py migrate
   $ ./manage.py createsuperuser
   $ ./manage.py runserver

Open the sample site in your browser at http://localhost:8000/ and the CMS
at http://localhost:8000/admin/.

Scaffolding a site in an existing repository
--------------------------------------------

It's not always desirable to create a new directory for an application,
especially when scaffolding an application for a repository that's already
been created. Specifically for that Molo allows a second argument for the
directory.

To scaffold an application called ``myapp`` in the current directory do::

   $ molo scaffold myapp .

Specifying extra requires
-------------------------

Molo in itself is not expected to be enough to deliver on a client request.
During scaffolding use the ``--require`` commandline parameter to include
more libraries that are required for installation::

   $ molo scaffold myapp --require=django-contrib-comments

Adds the `django-contrib-comments` to the generated requirements file which
is read by the generated package's ``setup.py`` file.

Multiple requires can be specified on the command line::

   $ molo scaffold myapp --require=django-contrib-comments

Automatically adding installed apps
-----------------------------------

If you're including a Django app chances are you're going to want to
add it to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` settings as well as adding an entry
to the generated ``urls.py`` file::

   $ molo scaffold myapp --include=django_comments ^comments/

This results in the following ``urls.py`` entry::

   url(r'^comments/',
       include('django_comments.urls',
               namespace='django_comments',
               app_name='django_comments')),

.. note:: multiple includes can be specified on the command line, the format
          is ``--include=<app_name> <regex-for-urls>``

For convenience, here's the full scaffold command for the current plugins::

    $ molo scaffold myapp \
        --require=django-contrib-comments --include=django_comments ^comments/ \
        --require=molo.commenting --include=molo.commenting ^commenting/ \
        --require=molo.yourwords --include=molo.yourwords ^yourwords/

Molo, Django & settings files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What you have now is a standard Django application set up for normal
development like outlined in the Django documentation. The only main difference
is that your settings are Python modules found in the
``settings/dev.py`` and ``settings/production.py`` files in your applications
folder. Both of these inherit settings from ``settings/base.py``.

To create your own custom settings add a ``local.py`` file in the ``settings``
folder. The ``settings/dev.py`` will automatically include those settings
for your local development environment.

Unpacking Templates from Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes a package's existing templates simply are not enough and need
some amount of customization. Use the ``unpack-templates`` command in the
scaffolded application to unpack a package's templates in your application's
templates directory::

   $ molo scaffold testapp
   $ pip install -e testapp
   ...

You'll see the default templates that ``molo.core`` ships with available in
the ``templates`` directory::

   $ ls testapp/testapp/templates
   404.html  500.html  base.html core

Now we unpack the ``profiles`` templates directory from the ``molo.profiles``
package into the ``testapp`` package template directory::

   $ molo unpack-templates molo.profiles testapp
   $ ls testapp/testapp/templates
   404.html  500.html  base.html core profiles

The format is::

   $ molo unpack-templates <source package> <target package>

Running tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now develop your application and write tests for the features you add.
Running your tests for Django works as you would expect::

   $ ./manage.py test


What is bundled with Molo?
--------------------------

1. `Wagtail CMS`_
2. Basic feature phone template set.
3. Basic models for the following tree structure:

   1. A site has languages
   2. A language has a homepage
   3. Articles are organised into sections.
   4. Articles are composed from one or more blocks.
   5. Blocks can be headings, paragraphs, images, lists or
      links to other pages.
4. Molo Profiles: Provides code to help with User profiles in a project using the Molo code base.



Testing the Molo scaffolding tool
---------------------------------

If you're interested in working on or contributing to the code that
does the scaffolding then clone this repository from the GitHub repository at
http://github.com/praekelt/molo.

Install the requirement development & testing dependencies::

   $ pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

And then run the full test suite with::

   $ py.test

Pull requests are expected to follow Praekelt's `Ways Of Working`_.
